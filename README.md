# totoboto4-Module-SDK

üåè [Documentation Fran√ßaise](README.fr.md)

This is the development kit of [totoboto4](https://github.com/totobono4/totoboto4).
Use it as a template for your module project, like described in the [README.md](https://github.com/totobono4/totoboto4#readme) of [totoboto4](https://github.com/totobono4/totoboto4).

This SDK contains a `ping` example command.

Please fill the name and version in `module.js` before using it.

Thanks to this SDK, you'll be able to use the `Discord.js` API, as third party project. It allows you to use `npm` dependencies without messing with the server environment, and provide an open source easily modulable discord bot.
